## Internationalization vs Localization

Internationalization and localization represent two sides to the same coin. Together, they allow you to deliver your web application's content to different locales.

    __Internationalization__, represented by i18n (18 is the number of letters between i and n), is the processing of developing your application so that it can be used by different locales. This process is generally handled by developers.

    __Localization__, represented by l10n (10 is the number of letters between l and n), on the other hand, is the process of translating your application to a particular language and locale. This is generally handled by translators.
